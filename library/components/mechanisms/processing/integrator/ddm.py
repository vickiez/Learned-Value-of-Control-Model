.. _DDM_Overview:

Overview
--------
The DDM Mechanism implements the "Drift Diffusion Model" (also know as the Diffusion Decision, Accumulation to Bound,
Linear IntegratorFunction, and Wiener Process First Passage Time Model [REFS]). This corresponds to a continuous version of
the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT [REF]), that is the statistically optimal procedure for two alternative
forced choice (TAFC) decision making ([REF]).

The DDM Mechanism may be constructed with a choice of several functions that fall into to general categories: analytic
solutions and path integration (see `DDM_Modes` below for more about these options.)

.. _DDM_Creation:

Creating a DDM Mechanism
-----------------------------
A DDM Mechanism can be instantiated directly by calling its constructor, or by using the `mechanism` command and
specifying DDM as its **mech_spec** argument.  The model implementation is selected using the `function <DDM.function>`
argument. The function selection can be simply the name of a DDM function::

    >>> import psyneulink as pnl
    >>> my_DDM = pnl.DDM(function=pnl.DriftDiffusionAnalytical)

or a call to the function with arguments specifying its parameters::

    >>> my_DDM = pnl.DDM(function=pnl.DriftDiffusionAnalytical(drift_rate=0.2, threshold=1.0))


COMMENT:
.. _DDM_Input:
**Input**.  The `default_variable` argument specifies the default value to use as the stimulus component of the
:ref:`drift rate <DDM_Drift_Rate>` for the decision process.  It must be a single scalar value.
[TBI - MULTIPROCESS DDM - REPLACE ABOVE]
**Input**.  The ``default_variable`` argument specifies the default value to use as the stimulus component of the
:ref:`drift rate <DDM_Drift_Rate>` for each decision process, as well as the number of decision processes implemented
and the corresponding format of the ``input`` required by calls to its ``execute`` and ``run`` methods.  This can be a
single scalar value or an an array (list or 1d np.array). If it is a single value (as in the first two examples above),
a single DDM process is implemented, and the input is used as the stimulus component of the
:ref:`drift rate <DDM_Drift_Rate>` for the process. If the input is an array (as in the third example above),
multiple parallel DDM processes are implemented all of which use the same parameters but each of which receives its
own input (from the corresponding element of the input array) and is executed independently of the others.
COMMENT

.. _DDM_Structure:

Structure
---------

The DDM Mechanism implements a general form of the decision process.

.. _DDM_Input:

*Input*
~~~~~~~

The input to the `function <DDM_Function>` of a DDM Mechanism is always a scalar, irrespective of `type of function
<DDM_Modes>` that is used.  Accordingly, the default `InputState` for a DDM takes a single scalar value as its input,
that represents the stimulus for the decision process.  However, this can be configured using the **input_format**
argument of the DDM's consructor, to accomodate use of the DDM with other Mechanisms that generate a stimulus array
(e.g., representing the stimuli associated with each of the two choices). By default, the **input_format** is
*SCALAR*.  However, if it is specified as *ARRAY*, the DDM's InputState is configured to accept a 1d 2-item vector,
and to use `Reduce` as its Function, which subtracts the 2nd element of the vector from the 1st, and provides this as
the input to the DDM's `function <DDM.function>`.  If *ARRAY* is specified, two  `Standard OutputStates
<DDM_Standard_OutputStates>` are added to the DDM, that allow the result of the decision process to be represented
as an array corresponding to the input array (see `below <DDM_Custom_OutputStates>`).

COMMENT:
ADD EXAMPLE HERE
COMMENT

COMMENT
NOTE SURE WHAT THIS MEANS:
That parameter, along with all of the others for the DDM, must be assigned as
parameters of the DDM's `function <DDM.function>` (see examples under `DDM_Modes` below, and individual `Functions
<Function>` for additional details).
COMMENT

.. _DDM_Output:

*Output*
~~~~~~~~

The DDM Mechanism can generate two different types of results depending on which function is selected. When a
function representing an analytic solution is selected, the mechanism generates a single estimation for the process.
When the path integration function is selected, the mechanism carries out step-wise integration of the process; each
execution of the mechanism computes one step. (see `DDM_Modes` and `DDM_Execution` for additional details).

The `value <DDM.value>` of the DDM Mechanism may have up to ten items. The first two of these are always assigned, and
are represented by the DDM Mechanism's two default `output_states <DDM.output_states>`: `DECISION_VARIABLE
<DDM_DECISION_VARIABLE>` and `RESPONSE_TIME <DDM_RESPONSE_TIME>`.  Other `output_states <DDM.output_states>` may be
automatically assigned, depending on the `function <DDM.function>` that has been assigned to the DDM, as shown in the
table below:

.. _DDM_Custom_OutputStates:

The `output_states <DDM.output_states>` assigned to a DDM can be customized by specifying a list of the desired DDM
`Standard OutputStates <DDM_Standard_OutputStates>` in the **output_states** argument of its constructor, or the
*OUTPUT_STATES* entry of an `OutputState specification dictionary <OutputState_Specification_Dictionary>`.  This can
include two additional `Standard OutputStates <DDM_Standard_OutputStates>` for the DDM - `DECISION_VARIABLE_ARRAY
<DDM_OUTPUT.DDM_DECISION_VARIABLE_ARRAY>` and `SELECTED_INPUT_ARRAY <DDM_OUTPUT.DDM_SELECTED_INPUT_ARRAY>`,
that are available  if the *ARRAY* option is specified in its **input_format** argument (see `DDM_Input`).  As with
any Mechanism, `customized OutputStates <OutputState_Customization>` can also be created and assigned.

.. _DDM_Modes:

*DDM Function Types*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _DDM_Analytic_Mode:

Analytic Solutions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Drift Diffusion Model `Functions <Function>` that calculate analytic solutions
[Bogacz et al (2006), Srivastava et al. (2016)] is `DriftDiffusionAnalytical <DriftDiffusionAnalytical>`
`function <DDM.function>`, the mechanism generates a single estimate of the outcome for the decision process (see
`DDM_Execution` for details). In addition to `DECISION_VARIABLE <DDM_DECISION_VARIABLE>` and
`RESPONSE_TIME <DDM_RESPONSE_TIME>`, the Function returns an accuracy value (represented in the
`PROBABILITY_UPPER_THRESHOLD <DDM_PROBABILITY_UPPER_THRESHOLD>` OutputState), and an error rate value (in the `PROBABILITY_LOWER_THRESHOLD <DDM_PROBABILITY_LOWER_THRESHOLD>`
OutputState, and moments (mean, variance, and skew) for conditional (correct\positive or incorrect\negative) response time distributions.
These are; the mean RT for correct responses  (`RT_CORRECT_MEAN <DDM_RT_CORRECT_MEAN>`, the RT variance for correct responses
(`RT_CORRECT_VARIANCE <DDM_RT_CORRECT_VARIANCE>`, the RT skew for correct responses (`RT_CORRECT_SKEW <DDM_RT_CORRECT_SKEW>`,
the mean RT for incorrect responses  (`RT_INCORRECT_MEAN <DDM_RT_INCORRECT_MEAN>`, the RT variance for incorrect
responses (`RT_INCORRECT_VARIANCE <DDM_RT_INCORRECT_VARIANCE>`, the RT skew for incorrect responses
(`RT_INCORRECT_SKEW <DDM_RT_INCORRECT_SKEW>`.

An example that illustrate all of the parameters is shown below:

`DriftDiffusionAnalytical <DriftDiffusionAnalytical>` Function::

    >>> my_DDM_DriftDiffusionAnalytical = pnl.DDM(
    ...     function=pnl.DriftDiffusionAnalytical(
    ...         drift_rate=0.08928,
    ...         starting_point=0.5,
    ...         threshold=0.2645,
    ...         noise=0.5,
    ...         t0=0.15
    ...     ),
    ...     name='my_DDM_DriftDiffusionAnalytical'
    ... )

.. _DDM_Integration_Mode:

Path Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Drift Diffusion Model `Function <Function>` that calculates a path integration is `DriftDiffusionIntegrator
<DriftDiffusionIntegrator>`. The DDM Mechanism uses the `Euler method <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method>`_ to
carry out numerical step-wise integration of the decision process (see `Execution <DDM_Execution>` below).  In this
mode, only the `DECISION_VARIABLE <DDM_DECISION_VARIABLE>` and `RESPONSE_TIME <DDM_RESPONSE_TIME>` are available.

`IntegratorFunction <IntegratorFunction>` Function::

    >>> my_DDM_path_integrator = pnl.DDM(
    ...     function=pnl.DriftDiffusionIntegrator(
    ...         noise=0.5,
    ...         initializer=1.0,
    ...         starting_point=2.0,
    ...         rate=3.0
    ...     ),
    ...     name='my_DDM_path_integrator'
    ... )

COMMENT:
[TBI - MULTIPROCESS DDM - REPLACE ABOVE]
The DDM Mechanism implements a general form of the decision process.  A DDM Mechanism assigns one **inputState** to
each item in the `default_variable` argument, corresponding to each of the decision processes implemented
(see :ref:`Input <DDM_Input>` above). The decision process can be configured to execute in different modes.  The
`function <DDM.function>` parameters is the primary determinants of how the
decision process is executed, and what information is returned. The `function <DDM.function>` parameter specifies
the analytical solution to use. The number of `OutputStates <OutputState>` is determined by the `function <DDM.function>` in use (see
:ref:`list of output values <DDM_Results>` below).

[TBI - average_output_states ARGUMENT/OPTION AFTER IMPLEMENTING MULTIPROCESS DDM]
OUTPUT MEASURE?? OUTCOME MEASURE?? RESULT?? TYPE OF RESULT??
If only a single decision process was run, then the value of each outputState is the corresponding output of
the decision process.  If there is more than one decision process (i.e., the input has more than one item), then
the content of the outputStates is determined by the ``average_output_states`` argument.  If it is `True`,
then each outputState (and item of ``output_values``) contains a single value, which is the average of the output
values of that type over all of the processes run.  If ``average_output_states`` is :keyword:`False` (the default),
then the value of each ouputState is a 1d array, each element of which is the outcome of that type for the
corresponding decision process.
COMMENT


COMMENT:  [OLD;  PUT SOMEHWERE ELSE??]

    The DDM process uses the same set of parameters for all modes of execution.  These can be specified as arguments
    for the functions used in TRIAL mode, or in a params dictionary assigned to the `params` argument,
    using the keywords in the list below, as in the following example::
        my_DDM = DDM(
            function=DriftDiffusionAnalytical(drift_rate=0.1),
            params={
                DRIFT_RATE:(0.2, ControlProjection),
                STARTING_POINT:-0.5
            },
        )
    The parameters for the DDM when `function <DDM.function>` is set to `DriftDiffusionAnalytical` are:

    .. _DDM_Drift_Rate:

    * `DRIFT_RATE <drift_rate>` (default 0.0)
      - multiplies the input to the Mechanism before assigning it to the `variable <DDM.variable>` on each call of
      `function <DDM.function>`.  The resulting value is further multiplied by the value of any ControlProjections to
      the `DRIFT_RATE` parameterState. The `drift_rate` parameter can be thought of as the "automatic" component
      (baseline strength) of the decision process, the value received from a ControlProjection as the "attentional"
      component, and the input its "stimulus" component.  The product of all three determines the drift rate in
      effect for each time_step of the decision process.
    ..
    * `STARTING_POINT <starting_point>` (default 0.0)
      - specifies the starting value of the decision variable.
    ..
    * `THRESHOLD` (default 1.0)
      - specifies the stopping value for the decision process. The `threshold` parameter must be greater than or
      equal to zero.
    ..
    * `NOISE` (default 0.5)
      - specifies the variance of the stochastic ("diffusion") component of the decision process.
    ..
    * `NON_DECISION_TIME` (default 0.2)
      specifies the `t0` parameter of the decision process (in units of seconds).

[TBI - MULTIPROCESS DDM - REPLACE BELOW]
When a DDM Mechanism is executed it computes the decision process, either analytically (in TRIAL mode)
or by step-wise integration (in TIME_STEP mode).  As noted above, if the input is a single value,
it computes a single DDM process.  If the input is a list or array, then multiple parallel DDM processes are executed,
with each element of the input used for the corresponding process.  All use the same set of parameters,
so the analytic solutions (used in TRIAL mode) for a given input will be the same; to implement processes in
this mode that use different parameters, a separate DDM Mechanism should explicitly be created for each. In
TIME_STEP mode, the noise term will resolve to different values in each time step, so the integration
paths and outcomes for the same input value will vary. This can be used to generate distributions of the process for a
single set of parameters that are not subject to the analytic solution (e.g., for time-varying drift rates).

.. note::
   DDM handles "runtime" parameters (specified in a call to its
   :py:meth:`execute <Mechanism_Base.exeucte>` or :py:meth:`run <Mechanism_Base.run>` methods)
   differently than standard Components: runtime parameters are added to the Mechanism's current value of the
   corresponding ParameterState (rather than overriding it);  that is, they are combined additively with the value of
   any `ControlProjection` it receives to determine the parameter's value for that execution.  The ParameterState's
   value is then restored to its original value (i.e., either its default value or the one assigned when it was
   created) for the next execution.

COMMENT

.. _DDM_Execution:

Execution
---------

When a DDM Mechanism is executed, it computes the decision process either `analytically <DDM_Analytic_Mode>`  or by
`numerical step-wise integration <DDM_Integration_Mode>` of its path.  The method used is determined by its `function
<DDM.function>` (see `DDM_Modes`). The DDM's `function <DDM.function>` always returns values for the `DECISION_VARIABLE
<DDM_DECISION_VARIABLE>` and `RESPONSE_TIME <DDM_RESPONSE_TIME>`, and assigns these as the first two items of its `value
<DDM.value>` attribute, irrespective of its function.

When an `analytic <DDM_Analytic_Mode>` function is selected, the same set of values is returned for every execution.
The returned values are determined entirely by the set of parameters passed to its `function <DDM.function>`.

When the `path integration <DDM_Integration_Mode>`, function is selected, a single step of integration is conducted each
time the Mechanism is executed. The returned values accumulate on every execution.

The analytic functions return a final positon and time of the model, along with other statistics, where as the path
integration function returns intermediate position and time values. The two types of functions can be thought of as
happening on different time scales: trial (analytic) and time step (path integration).

        Description
        -----------
            DDM is a subclass Type of the Mechanism Category of the Component class
            It implements a Mechanism for several forms of the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) for
                two alternative forced choice (2AFC) decision making:
                - analytical solution [Bogacz et al. (2006), Srivastava et al. (2016)]
                     - stochastically estimated decion outcome (convert mean ER into value between 1 and -1)
                     - mean ER
                     - mean RT
                     - mean, variance, and skew of RT for correct (posititive threshold) responses
                     - mean, variance, and skew of RT for incorrect (negative threshold) responses
                - stepwise integrator that simulates each step of the integration process

    COMMENT

    Arguments
    ---------

    default_variable : value, list or np.ndarray : default FUNCTION_PARAMS[STARTING_POINT]
        the input to the Mechanism used if none is provided in a call to its `execute <Mechanism_Base.execute>` or
        `run <Mechanism_Base.run>` methods; also serves as a template to specify the length of the `variable
        <DDM.variable>` for its `function <DDM.function>`, and the `primary OutputState <OuputState_Primary>` of the
        DDM (see `Input` <DDM_Creation>` for how an input with a length of greater than 1 is handled).

    size : int, list or np.ndarray of ints
        specifies the `default_variable <DDM.default_variable>` as array(s) of zeros if **default_variable** is not
        passed as an argument; if **default_variable** is specified, it takes precedence over the specification of
        **size**. As an example, the following mechanisms are equivalent::
            T1 = TransferMechanism(size = [3, 2])
            T2 = TransferMechanism(default_variable = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0]])

    function : IntegratorFunction : default DriftDiffusionAnalytical
        specifies the function to use to `execute <DDM_Execution>` the decision process; determines the mode of
        execution (see `function <DDM.function>` and `DDM_Modes` for additional information).

    params : Dict[param keyword: param value] : default None
        a dictionary that can be used to specify parameters of the Mechanism, parameters of its `function
        <DDM.function>`, and/or  a custom function and its parameters (see `Mechanism <Mechanism>` for specification of
        a params dict).

    name : str : default see `name <DDM.name>`
        specifies the name of the DDM.

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : default Mechanism.classPreferences
        specifies the `PreferenceSet` for the DDM; see `prefs <DDM.prefs>` for details.

    COMMENT:
    context=componentType+INITIALIZING):
        context : str : default ''None''
               string used for contextualization of instantiation, hierarchical calls, executions, etc.
    COMMENT

    Attributes
    ----------
    variable : value : default  FUNCTION_PARAMS[STARTING_POINT]
        the input to Mechanism's execute method.  Serves as the "stimulus" component of the `function <DDM.function>`'s
        **drift_rate** parameter.

    function :  IntegratorFunction : default DriftDiffusionAnalytical
        the function used to `execute <DDM_Execution>` the decision process; determines the mode of execution.
        If it is `DriftDiffusionAnalytical <DriftDiffusionAnalytical>`, an `analytic solution
        <DDM_Analytic_Mode>` is calculated (note:  the latter requires that the MatLab engine is installed); if it is
        an `IntegratorFunction` Function with an `integration_type <IntegratorFunction.integration_type>` of *DIFFUSION*,
        then `numerical step-wise integration <DDM_Integration_Mode>` is carried out.  See `DDM_Modes` and
        `DDM_Execution` for additional information.
        COMMENT:
           IS THIS MORE CORRECT FOR ABOVE:
               if it is `DriftDiffusionIntegrator`, then `numerical step-wise integration <DDM_Integration_Mode>`
               is carried out.
        COMMENT

    value : 2d np.array[array(float64),array(float64),array(float64),array(float64)]
        result of executing DDM `function <DDM.function>`;  has six items, that are assigned based on the `function
        <DDM.function>` attribute.  The first two items are always assigned the values of `DECISION_VARIABLE
        <DDM_DECISION_VARIABLE>` and `RESPONSE_TIME <DDM_RESPONSE_TIME>` (though their interpretation depends on the
        `function <DDM.function>` and corresponding `mode of <DDM_Modes>` of operation).  See `DDM_Modes`,
        `DDM_Execution`, and `DDM Standard OutputStates <DDM_Standard_OutputStates>` for additional information about
        other values that can be reported and their interpretation.

    output_states : ContentAddressableList[OutputState]
        list of the DDM's `OutputStates <OutputState>`.  There are always two OutputStates, `DECISION_VARIABLE
        <DDM_DECISION_VARIABLE>` and `RESPONSE_TIME <DDM_RESPONSE_TIME>`; additional ones may be included
        based on the `function <DDM.function>` and/or any specifications made in the **output_states** argument of the
        DDM's constructor (see `DDM Standard OutputStates <DDM_Standard_OutputStates>`).

    output_values : List[array(float64),array(float64),array(float64),array(float64)]
        each item is the `value <OutputState.value> of the corresponding OutputState in `output_states
        <DDM.output_states>`.  The first two items are always the `value <OutputState.value>`\\s of the
        `DECISION_VARIABLE <DDM_DECISION_VARIABLE>` and `RESPONSE_TIME <DDM_RESPONSE_TIME>` OutputStates;  additional
        ones may be included, based on the `function <DDM.function>` and any specifications made in the
        **output_states** argument of the DDM's constructor (see `DDM Standard OutputStates
        <DDM_Standard_OutputStates>`).

    name : str
        the name of the DDM; if it is not specified in the **name** argument of the constructor, a default is
        assigned by MechanismRegistry (see `Naming` for conventions used for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict
        the `PreferenceSet` for the DDM; if it is not specified in the **prefs** argument of the constructor, a default
        is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).
