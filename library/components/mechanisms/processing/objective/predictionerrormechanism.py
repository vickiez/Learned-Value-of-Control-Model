Overview
--------

A PredictionErrorMechanism is a subclass of `ComparatorMechanism` that receives
two inputs (a sample and a target), and calculates the temporal difference
prediction error as found in `Montague, Dayan, and Sejnowski (1996) <http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/16/5/1936.full.pdf>`_
using its `function <PredictionErrorMechanism.function>`, and places the delta
values (the difference between the actual and predicted reward) in its *OUTCOME*
`OutputState <PredictionErrorMechanism.output_state>`.

.. _PredictionErrorMechanism_Creation:

Creating a PredictionErrorMechanism
-----------------------------------

A PredictionErrorMechanism is usually created automatically when a `LearningMechanism`
`is created <LearningMechanism_Creation>` using the `TDLearning` function).
A PredictionErrorMechanism can also be created directly by calling its constructor.
Its **sample** and **target**  arguments are used to specify the OutputStates
that provide the sample and target inputs, respectively (see
`ObjectiveMechanism Monitored Output States <ObjectiveMechanism_Monitored_Output_States>`
for details). When the PredictionErrorMechanism is created, two InputStates are
created, one each for its sample and target inputs (and named, by default
*SAMPLE* and *TARGET*). Each is assigned a MappingProjection from the
corresponding OutputState specified in the **sample** and **target** arguments.

It is important to recognize that the value of the *SAMPLE* and *TARGET*
InputStates must have the same length and type, so that they can be compared
using the PredictionErrorMechanism's `function
<PredictionErrorMechanism.function>` By default, they use the format of the
OutputStates specified in the **sample** and **target** arguments, respectively,
and the `MappingProjection` to each uses an `IDENTITY_MATRIX`. Therefore, for
the default configuration, the OutputStates specified in the **sample** and
**target** arguments must have values of the same length and type. If these
differ, the **input_states** argument can be used to explicitly specify the
format of the PredictionErrorMechanism's *SAMPLE* and *TARGET* InputStates, to
insure they are compatible with one another (as well as to customize their
names, if desired). If the **input_states** argument is used, *both* the sample
and target InputStates must be specified. Any of the formats for `specifying
InputStates <InputState_Specification>` can be used in the argument. If values
are assigned for the InputStates, they must be of equal length and type. Their
types must also be compatible with the value of the OutputStates specified in
the **sample** and **target** arguments. However, the length specified for an
InputState can differ from its corresponding OutputState; in that case, by
default, the MappingProjection created uses a `FULL_CONNECTIVITY` matrix. Thus,
OutputStates of differing lengths can be mapped to the sample and target
InputStates of a PredictionErrorMechanism (see the `example
<PredictionErrorMechanism_Example>` below), so long as the latter of of the
same length. If a projection other than a `FULL_CONNECTIVITY` matrix is
needed, this can be specified using the *PROJECTION* entry of a `State
specification dictionary <State_Specification>` for the InputState in the
**input_states** argument.

.. _PredictionErrorMechanism_Structure:

Structure
---------

A PredictionErrorMechanism has two `input_states
<ComparatorMechanism.input_states>`, each of which receives a
`MappingProjection` from a corresponding OutputState specified in the
**sample** and **target** arguments of its constructor. The InputStates are
listed in the Mechanism's `input_states <ComparatorMechanism.input_states>`
attribute and named, respectively, *SAMPLE* and *TARGET*. The OutputStates
from which they receive their projections (specified in the **sample** and
**target** arguments) are listed in the Mechanism's `sample
<ComparatorMechanism.sample>` and `target
<ComparatorMechanism.target>` attributes as well as in its
`monitored_output_states <ComparatorMechanism.monitored_output_states>`
attribute. The PredictionErrorMechanism's `function
<PredictionErrorMechanism.function>` calculates the difference between the
predicted reward and the true reward at each timestep in **SAMPLE**. By
default, it uses a `PredictionErrorDeltaFunction`. However, the
`function <PredictionErrorMechanism.function>` can be customized, so long as it
is replaced with one that takes two arrays with the same format as its inputs
and generates a similar array as its result. The result is assigned as the
value of the PredictionErrorMechanism's *OUTCOME* (`primary
<OutputState_Primary>`) OutputState.

.. _PredictionErrorMechanism_Function:

Execution
---------

When a PredictionErrorMechanism is executed, it updates its input_states with
the values of the OutputStates specified in its **sample** and **target**
arguments, and then uses its `function <PredictionErrorMechanism.function>` to
compare these. By default, the result is assigned to the `value
<PredictionErrorMechanism.value>` of its *OUTCOME* `output_state
<PredictionErrorMechanism.output_state>`, and as the first item of the
Mechanism's `output_values <PredictionErrorMechanism.output_values>` attribute.

.. _PredictionErrorMechanism_Example:

Example
-------

.. _PredictionErrorMechanism_Default_Input_Value_Example:

*Formatting InputState values*

The **default_variable** argument can be used to specify a particular format
for the SAMPLE and/or TARGET InputStates of a PredictionErrorMechanism. This
can be useful when one or both of these differ from the format of the
OutputState(s) specified in the **sample** and **target** arguments. For
example, for `Temporal Difference Learning <TDLearning>`, a
PredictionErrorMechanism is used to compare the predicted reward from the
sample with the true reward (the target). In the example below, the sample
Mechanism is a `TransferMechanism` that uses the `Linear` function to output
the sample values. Because the output is a vector, specifying it as the
PredictionErrorMechanism's **sample** argument will generate a corresponding
InputState with a vector as its value. This should match the reward
signal specified in the PredictionErrorMechanism's **target** argument, the
value of which is a vector of the same length as the output of sample.

    >>> import psyneulink as pnl
    >>> sample_mech = pnl.TransferMechanism(size=5,
    ...                                     function=pnl.Linear())
    >>> reward_mech = pnl.TransferMechanism(size=5)
    >>> prediction_error_mech = pnl.PredictionErrorMechanism(sample=sample_mech,
    ...                                                      target=reward_mech)

Note that ``sample_mech`` is specified to take an array of length 5 as its
input, and therefore generate one of the same length as its `primary output
<OutputState_Primary>`. Since it is assigned as the **sample** of the
PredictionErrorMechanism, by default this will create a *SAMPLE* InputState of
length 5, that will match the length of the *TARGET* InputState.

Currently the default method of implementing temporal difference learning in
PsyNeuLink requires the values of *SAMPLE* and *TARGET* to be provided as an
array representing a full time series as an experiment. See
`MontagueDayanSejnowski.py` in the Scripts folder for an example.
