Overview
--------

An LCAMechanism is a subclass of `RecurrentTransferMechanism` that implements a single-layered leaky competitive accumulator
network, in which each element is connected to every other element with mutually inhibitory weights. The LCAMechanism's recurrent
projection matrix *always* consists of `self_excitation <LCAMechanism.self_excitation>` on the diagonal and -`competition
<LCAMechanism.competition>` off-diagonal.

    COMMENT

When all of the following conditions are true:

- The `LCAMechanism` mechanism has two elements
- The value of its `competition <LCAMechanism.competition>` parameter is equal to its `leak <LCAMechanism.leak>` parameter
- `Competition <LCAMechanism.competition>` and `leak <LCAMechanism.leak>` are of sufficient magnitude

then the `LCAMechanism` implements a close approximation of a `DDM` Mechanism (see `Usher & McClelland, 2001;
<http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.3.550>`_ and `Bogacz et al (2006)
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17014301>`_).

.. _Recurrent_Transfer_Creation:

Creating an LCAMechanism
------------------------

An LCAMechanism can be created directly by calling its constructor.

The self-excitatory and mutually-inhibitory connections are implemented as a recurrent `MappingProjection`
with a `matrix <LCAMechanism.matrix>` in which the diagonal consists of uniform weights specified by **self_excitation** and the
off-diagonal consists of uniform weights specified by the *negative* of the **competition** argument.

The *noise*, *leak*, *initial_value*, and *time_step_size* arguments are used to implement the `LeakyCompetingIntegrator`
as the `LCAMechanism.integrator_function <LCAMechanism.integrator_function>` of the mechanism. *integrator_mode* determines whether the
`LCAMechanism.integrator_function <LCAMechanism.integrator_function>` will execute.

**When integrator_mode is set to True:**

the variable of the mechanism is first passed into the following equation:

.. math::
    leak \\cdot previous\\_value + variable + noise \\sqrt{time\\_step\\_size}

The result of the integrator function above is then passed into the `mechanism's function <LCAMechanism.function>`. Note that on the
first execution, *initial_value* sets previous_value.

**When integrator_mode is set to False:**

The variable of the mechanism is passed into the `function of the mechanism <LCAMechanism.function>`. The mechanism's
`integrator_function <LCAMechanism.integrator_function>` is skipped entirely, and all related arguments (*noise*, *leak*,
*initial_value*, and *time_step_size*) are ignored.

COMMENT:
The default format of its `variable <LCAMechanism.variable>`, and default values of its `inhibition
<LCAMechanism.inhibition>`, `decay <RecurrentTransferMechanism.decay>` and `noise <TransferMechanism.noise>` parameters
implement an approximation of a `DDM`.
COMMENT

.. _LCAMechanism_Structure:

Structure
---------

The key distinguishing features of an LCAMechanism are:

1. its `integrator_function <LCAMechanism.integrator_function>`, which implements the `LeakyCompetingIntegrator`. (Note that a
standard `RecurrentTransferMechanism` would implement the `AdaptiveIntegrator` as its `integrator_function
<RecurrentTransferMechanism.integrator_function>`)

2. its `matrix <LCAMechanism.matrix>` consisting of `self_excitation <LCAMechanism.self_excitation>` and `competition <LCAMechanism.competition>`
off diagonal.

In addition to its `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>` (which contains the current value of the
elements of the LCAMechanism) and the OutputStates of a RecurrentTransferMechanism, it has two additional OutputStates:

- `MAX_VS_NEXT <LCAMechanism.LCAMechanism_OUTPUT.MAX_VS_NEXT>`
- `MAX_VS_AVG <MAX_VS_AVG>`

Both are two element arrays that track the element of the LCAMechanism with the currently highest value relative
to the value of the others.

The two elements of the `MAX_VS_NEXT` OutputState contain, respectively, the index of the
LCAMechanism element with the greatest value, and the difference between its value and the next highest one. `MAX_VS_AVG`
contains the index of the LCAMechanism element with the greatest value, and the difference between its value and the average
of all the others.

For an LCAMechanism with only two elements, `MAX_VS_NEXT` implements a close approximation of the
`threshold <DDM.threshold>` parameter of a `DDM`
(see `Usher & McClelland, 2001; <http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.3.550>`_ and
`Bogacz et al (2006) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17014301>`_).
For an LCAMechanism with more than two elements, `MAX_VS_NEXT` and
`MAX_VS_AVERAGE` implement threshold approximations with different properties
(see `McMillen & Holmes, 2006 <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022249605000891>`_).

        (:math:`x_{i}`) on each time step. See `LeakyCompetingIntegrator <LeakyCompetingIntegrator>` for more details on what the
        `LeakyCompetingIntegrator function  <LeakyCompetingIntegrator>` computes.

    noise : float or function : default 0.0
        a value added to the result of the `function <LCAMechanism.function>` or to the result of `integrator_function

        `noise <LCAMechanism.noise>` for more details.

    integrator_mode : boolean : default True
        determines whether the LCAMechanism will execute its `integrator_function <LCAMechanism.integrator_function>`. See

        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` that can be used to specify the parameters for
        the Mechanism, its function, and/or a custom function and its parameters.  Values specified for parameters in

        the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of the `recurrent_projection` for the Mechanism, the
        `self_excitation <LCAMechanism.self_excitation>` attribute sets the values on the diagonal, and the

    leak : value : default 0.5
        sets the `rate <LeakyCompetingIntegrator.rate>` on the `LeakyCompetingIntegrator function <LeakyCompetingIntegrator>`, which scales the

    competition : value : default 1.0
        sets the magnitude of the off-diagonal terms in the LCAMechanism's recurrent projection, thereby scaling the
        contributions of the competing unit (all :math:`f(x)_{j}` where :math:`j \\neq i`) to the accumulation of the

    recurrent_projection : MappingProjection
        a `MappingProjection` that projects from the Mechanism's `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>`
        back to it `primary inputState <Mechanism_InputStates>`.

    initial_value :  value, list or np.ndarray : Transfer_DEFAULT_BIAS
        determines the starting value for time-averaged input
        (only relevant if `beta <TransferMechanism.beta>` parameter is not 1.0).
        COMMENT:
            Transfer_DEFAULT_BIAS SHOULD RESOLVE TO A VALUE
        COMMENT

    integrator_function:
        When *integrator_mode* is set to True, the LCAMechanism executes its `integrator_function <LCAMechanism.integrator_function>`,
        which is the `LeakyCompetingIntegrator`. See `LeakyCompetingIntegrator <LeakyCompetingIntegrator>` for more details on what it computes.
        Keep in mind that the `leak <LCAMechanism.leak>` parameter of the `LCAMechanism` determines the `rate <LeakyCompetingIntegrator.rate>` of the
        `LeakyCompetingIntegrator`.

    integrator_mode:
        **When integrator_mode is set to True:**

        the variable of the mechanism is first passed into the following equation:

        .. math::
            leak \\cdot previous\\_value + variable + noise \\sqrt{time\\_step\\_size}

        The result of the integrator function above is then passed into the `mechanism's function <LCAMechanism.function>`. Note that
        on the first execution, *initial_value* sets previous_value.

        **When integrator_mode is set to False:**

        The variable of the mechanism is passed into the `function of the mechanism <LCAMechanism.function>`. The mechanism's
        `integrator_function <LCAMechanism.integrator_function>` is skipped entirely, and all related arguments (*noise*, *leak*,
        *initial_value*, and *time_step_size*) are ignored.

    noise : float or function : default 0.0
        When `integrator_mode <LCAMechanism.integrator_mode>` is set to True, noise is passed into the `integrator_function
        <LCAMechanism.integrator_function>`. Otherwise, noise is added to the output of the `function <LCAMechanism.function>`.

        If noise is a list or array, it must be the same length as `variable <LCAMechanism.default_variable>`.

        If noise is specified as a single float or function, while `variable <LCAMechanism.variable>` is a list or array,
        noise will be applied to each variable element. In the case of a noise function, this means that the function
        will be executed separately for each variable element.

        .. note::
            In order to generate random noise, we recommend selecting a probability distribution function
            (see `Distribution Functions <DistributionFunction>` for details), which will generate a new noise value from
            its distribution on each execution. If noise is specified as a float or as a function with a fixed output, then
            the noise will simply be an offset that remains the same across all executions.

    clip : list [float, float] : default None (Optional)
        specifies the allowable range for the result of `function <LCAMechanism.function>`

        the item in index 0 specifies the minimum allowable value of the result, and the item in index 1 specifies the
        maximum allowable value; any element of the result that exceeds the specified minimum or maximum value is set to
         the value of `clip <LCAMechanism.clip>` that it exceeds.

    output_values : List[array(float64), float, float]
        a list with the following items:
        * **result** of the `function <LCAMechanism.function>` calculation (value of TRANSFER_RESULT OutputState);
        * **mean** of the result (:keyword:`value` of TRANSFER_MEAN OutputState)

        * **energy** of the result (:keyword:`value` of ENERGY OutputState);
        * **entropy** of the result (if the ENTROPY OutputState is present);
        * **max_vs_next** of the result (:keyword:`value` of MAX_VS_NEXT OutputState);
        * **max_vs_avg** of the result (:keyword:`value` of MAX_VS_AVG OutputState).

    name : str
        the name of the LCAMechanism Mechanism; if it is not specified in the **name** argument of the constructor, a
        default is assigned by MechanismRegistry (see `Naming` for conventions used for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict
        the `PreferenceSet` for the LCAMechanism Mechanism; if it is not specified in the **prefs** argument of the
        constructor, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py (see :doc:`PreferenceSet
        <LINK>` for details).
